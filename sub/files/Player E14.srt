00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:20,407
(The content of this drama is fictional.)

2
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:23,808
(Places, organizations, religions, and people are fictitious.)

3
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:33,598
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:35,507
We came here just in case you got beat up.

5
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:37,437
Let's not try to be cool and act alone.

6
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:39,337
Thank you anyway.

7
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:42,278
You should leave first. I'll take care of them.

8
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:49,587
You should follow them quickly.

9
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:53,928
Okay, I'll leave them to you.

10
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:57,357
I hate being in debt to people.

11
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,708
Is it all over?

12
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:16,867
Yes.

13
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,837
You completely beat him up.

14
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:26,678
Let's go to Ha Ri.

15
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,488
Why is he so full of energy?

16
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:34,758
He usually has a lot of energy stored.

17
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,928
Should we just leave him like this? Isn't he dead?

18
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:40,258
Should we just leave him like this?

19
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,037
Wait a minute. Please help me.

20
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:47,567
That person has a gun. He's on the wanted list.

21
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,738
- Wait a minute. - Stop, punk!

22
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:51,138
- Wait a minute. - Wait a minute.

23
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,277
- Let me go! - Gosh.

24
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:56,807
Stop!

25
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:59,418
- Hands in the air! - Hands in the air!

26
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,317
Hands in the air!

27
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,958
Hands in the air!

28
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:15,567
You punk!

29
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,597
Are you going to keep acting independently? Are you in puberty?

30
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,608
(The Last Episode)

31
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:03,508
Ha Ri.

32
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:06,948
Aren't you hurt?

33
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:08,717
What?

34
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:13,258
I'm okay.

35
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:17,597
Why would you play cheap and go solo like that?

36
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,097
Ha Ri... I mean, Su Hyuk.

37
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:32,308
Just call me as you did before. Su Hyuk, my foot.

38
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:43,518
All right. I know how you guys feel.

39
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,388
But I'll do this alone.

40
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:51,797
- Only I'm on the wanted list. - I'm on it as well.

41
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:55,128
He is too.

42
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,537
- What? - But not me.

43
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:01,438
Lucky you.

44
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,308
Why are you guys on the list? What happened?

45
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,847
When they were searching Prosecutor Jang's office,

46
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:10,777
I think they got their hands on ours as well.

47
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:15,618
He used to have data on us back when he was chasing us.

48
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,888
He doesn't know a thing about meticulousness.

49
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,027
All the more reason why you shouldn't get involved.

50
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:23,258
What do you mean? If we do this, we'll do it together.

51
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:25,558
He's right, and you don't even have a plan.

52
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,927
You don't know where "That Person" fled to.

53
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:31,198
Exactly. But we know.

54
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,308
What?

55
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:41,777
Don't tell me you guys...

56
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:44,648
- What do you mean? - Really?

57
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,487
Summon an emergency meeting this instant.

58
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,537
Gosh, why did they park their car here?

59
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:14,578
Many people pass by here. Goodness.

60
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:26,188
On my way up, I secretly attached it there.

61
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,787
Hey, this isn't all.

62
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:33,227
We also got Yoo Ki Hoon and Chairman Chun in custody.

63
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:37,097
Exactly. We pretty much ripped off their arms and legs.

64
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:38,998
And you still don't need us?

65
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,368
Unbelievable.

66
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,208
Everyone's on the wanted list except for Ah Ryung?

67
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,787
Fine, then. Let's do it.

68
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:58,487
All of us. Okay?

69
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:03,227
Byung Min and Jin Woong, get in my car.

70
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:05,157
Ah Ryung, get in the other car and follow us. Okay?

71
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:08,198
- We're taking two cars? - Yes, that'll be best.

72
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,498
Then I'll just go with her.

73
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:13,198
Just get in.

74
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:20,948
Okay, I'll go with Ha Ri.

75
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:22,708
I should go with him.

76
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,677
She drives too recklessly.

77
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,888
What do you mean? I'm the gentlest driver there is.

78
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:36,828
Right, come to think of it,

79
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:39,597
I was always carsick when I drove with her.

80
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,167
We'll go first, so follow us.

81
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:43,998
What is this?

82
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,208
Just follow us recklessly then.

83
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,448
Are you planning to do what I think you're going to do?

84
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:03,287
Yes.

85
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:05,118
That's the right thing to do.

86
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,058
I guess you're right.

87
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:14,068
What's your take on this?

88
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:20,198
I'm on the same boat.

89
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:27,347
Byung Min, the program still works on that car, right?

90
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:31,248
Oh, that? Yes, it does.

91
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:34,447
All right. Let's go.

92
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,787
Let's go.

93
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:11,018
Are you ready?

94
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,888
Yes, I am.

95
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,468
Are you sure you won't regret this?

96
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,098
This could be the end.

97
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:24,338
- I know, you punk. - Well,

98
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,998
it's no big deal to visit prison again.

99
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:32,037
I think I'm fine being incarcerated this time.

100
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,547
Last time, I was betrayed.

101
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:44,157
But this time, we're in this together, so it's okay.

102
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:48,457
So let's all hold hands and catch "That Person".

103
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,307
Do it.

104
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,478
All right. Let's see.

105
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:22,088
What?

106
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:27,797
Ha Ri, there's something wrong with the car, so let me check.

107
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,277
Ha Ri. Ha Ri.

108
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:47,118
Answer me!

109
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:54,687
Open the door.

110
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:56,258
Open it!

111
00:10:57,228 --> 00:10:59,098
Ha Ri, open the door!

112
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,968
Open the door. Open it!

113
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,638
Thank you for everything.

114
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:14,307
Open the door!

115
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,817
Open the door!

116
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:22,648
Just open it!

117
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,988
Open it!

118
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,197
Ha Ri!

119
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,697
All right, we're almost there. Just a bit more.

120
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:08,498
I think it's that way.

121
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,748
- It's that one, right? - Yes, it is.

122
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:24,618
Look into it.

123
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:30,187
The control room is on the second basement.

124
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:32,187
There are two guards at each door at the lobby.

125
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:36,557
There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 patrolling guards.

126
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:40,098
And I'm sure there are many more on standby in case of an emergency.

127
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,327
Why are there so many guards in the middle of the night?

128
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,667
I know. Just like what you said, this may really be the end.

129
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,167
Let me ask you for the last time.

130
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:51,177
- Will you not... - We won't, okay?

131
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,407
I'm already extremely nervous.

132
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,978
Why are you acting like a talkative, old man?

133
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,817
Okay, let's go before we run out of time.

134
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:02,618
Go.

135
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:18,768
(Control Room)

136
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:35,687
Don't be ridiculous.

137
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:54,407
- Everything's fine, right? - Yes.

138
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:05,118
Are you done yet?

139
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,547
Gosh.

140
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:18,398
I found it! Hurry!

141
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:22,728
This is footage from 10 minutes ago. It's from the 25th floor.

142
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,498
Do you have any footage from the corridor?

143
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:28,537
There aren't any. That's really strange.

144
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:30,407
Strangely, there is everything except that.

145
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,407
Something is suspicious.

146
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,508
Look at this!

147
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:38,917
Aren't these punks from the Min Chang Party?

148
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,917
I saw them on TV.

149
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:43,758
We came just in time.

150
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:47,427
Cut the power and prepare the broadcast as planned.

151
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:50,027
You should also upload the data from the campaign.

152
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,057
I'll go to the meeting room and set up the cameras.

153
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,998
Ha Ri, you really have to come back soon.

154
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:56,167
It only takes three minutes for the power to come back.

155
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,167
- Okay? - Okay. Don't worry.

156
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,567
You really have to come back soon.

157
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,407
He's making me nervous.

158
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:14,488
- Gosh. - I can't believe this.

159
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,138
(Emergency Meeting)

160
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:45,417
Where is it?

161
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:01,898
Please sit down.

162
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:11,878
(Danger)

163
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,248
It's 3 minutes. 3 minutes.

164
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,047
You have to finish it within three minutes and leave no matter what.

165
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,657
Okay.

166
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,067
Three...

167
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,738
Two...

168
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:39,498
One.

169
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:48,047
What happened? Why did the power go out suddenly?

170
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:49,478
- Turn the flashlights on. - Okay.

171
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:53,417
We have to...

172
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,358
What's happening?

173
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,657
How are these punks managing the building?

174
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:35,788
I don't even have my phone.

175
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,828
Don't worry and just wait.

176
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:40,598
It will be restored.

177
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,598
Control room, do you copy?

178
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:18,338
Yes, we're restoring it. It will come back within 30 seconds.

179
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:22,767
Ha Ri, we don't even have 30 seconds left. Hurry, okay?

180
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,177
10 seconds left.

181
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:14,727
5, 4, 3,

00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:17,957
- Did he do it? - 2.

183
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,098
Okay, we did it!

184
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:26,667
The positioning is perfect.

185
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,538
- Look at this. - Let's start the broadcast.

186
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:30,368
Let's call Prosecutor Jang before that.

187
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:31,538
- Really? - Okay.

188
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,818
If I do this,

189
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,588
you're going to pay for everything.

190
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,898
- Look at this. - What is this?

191
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,927
What is this?

192
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,667
Wait a minute.

193
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:58,868
That's right.

194
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:00,667

00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,947

198
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,898
Where is this coming from?

199
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:32,898
I don't know where it is, but it's a live broadcast.

200
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:35,038
Live?

201
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,207
That punk...

202
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:46,477
Prosecutor Jang, are you enjoying the broadcast?

203
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,048
You have to start working now.

204
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:51,618
Don't you know that you're wanted right now?

205
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:52,987
What if you get caught by doing this?

206
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,528
You're worrying about meaningless things again.

207
00:20:56,157 --> 00:21:00,257
That's enough. Just clean up for us before it's too late.

208
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,197
You should take responsibility.

209
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,437
I heard that you were the one who proposed to Ha Ri to work together.

210
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,808
I'll leave the address by text message.

211
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,977
Hello? Wait a minute. You punk!

212
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,677

214
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:27,828
Let's prepare to move first.

215
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:30,798
- Okay. - Prosecutor, will you also go?

216
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:31,798
Yes.

217
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,328
I should take responsibility for my words.

218
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:39,767
Let's go.

219
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:48,518
Are we done now?

220
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:50,917
No. I don't think so.

221
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,128
We have to upload the data we got from the campaign.

222
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:56,528
- Yes. - Okay.

223
00:21:58,328 --> 00:21:59,828
This will take care of everything.

224
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:01,667
Byung Min.

225
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:04,937
What is this punk doing here?

226
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:08,167
That crazy punk!

227
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:10,207
Darn it!

228
00:22:13,237 --> 00:22:14,578
Is it you again?

229

Who are you?

232
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:47,038
What is happening?

233
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:49,707
Who are you?

234
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:52,747
What is he doing?

235
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:02,157
Is it you again?

236
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:04,258
We need to finish our talk.

237
00:23:07,997 --> 00:23:09,467
Darn it!

238
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:12,937
You crazy punk, why did you go there?

239
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:14,667
Byung Min, let's just leave quickly.

240
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,937
That crazy punk loves being the center of attention.

241
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:19,637
Gosh.

242
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:27,387
It's Seon Building. You must catch those on the wanted list.

243
00:23:27,387 --> 00:23:28,417
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

244
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:46,068
(PLAYER0404 has started streaming live.)

245
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,937
What are these fools doing?

246
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:59,348
Gosh, why isn't the door opening?

247
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,618
You're more resilient than I expected.

248
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:10,258
Thank you.

249
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:13,028
Who... who is this?

250
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:15,628
I thought this was a restricted area.

251
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:20,437
He is Prosecutor Choi Hyun Ki's son.

252
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:22,167
- What? - What did you say?

253
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:23,937
Choi... Choi...

254
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:26,308
The one from the Special Team?

255
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:27,348
That's correct.

256
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:29,548
You all know very well.

257
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:32,778
I'm the son of Choi Hyun Ki, the man you falsely accused...

258
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:35,487
15 years ago.

259
00:24:36,947 --> 00:24:38,457
How could this be?

260
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:41,457
How does he know about the past?

261
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,628
Wasn't it supposed to be confidential?

262
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:44,858
It doesn't matter.

263
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:47,227
He will die in this room anyway.

264
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:53,737
- Hey. Hey. - Are you okay?

265
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:55,207
Hey.

266
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:58,808
- Hey, bring the emergency key. - Yes, sir.

(Emergency Meeting)

268
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:10,217
You haven't changed over the past 15 years.

269
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:15,288
Was Prosecutor Jang In Gyu the target this time?

270
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:17,598
To link him with the opposition party and the bribe?

271
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:19,828
Is that right?

272
00:25:23,028 --> 00:25:25,598
Was Prosecutor Jang In Gyu the target this time?

273
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,137
To link him with the opposition party and the bribe?

274
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:33,137
- Please hurry. - Yes, sir.

275
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:42,118
Are you just going to listen to what he's saying?

276
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:44,917
What if he discloses all of this?

277
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,018
Don't worry.

278
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,328
The entire country will know about this by now.

279
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:52,497
What?

280
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:54,768
- What is he saying? - What?

281
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:59,897
- What? - Are we being filmed?

282
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:02,868
He is Prosecutor Choi Hyun Ki's son.

283
00:26:03,838 --> 00:26:05,407
This is incredible.

284
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:08,108
I'm the son of Choi Hyun Ki, the man you falsely accused...

285
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,207
What is this?

286
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:10,818

287
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:12,917
How could this be?

How does he know about the past?

289
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:18,058
Wasn't it supposed to be confidential?

290
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:20,987
It doesn't matter. He will die in this room anyway.

291
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:22,758
No...

292
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:26,098
We... We were being filmed.

293
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:27,298
What should we do?

294
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:29,967
- Sir. - You scumbag.

295
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:31,838
You said...

296
00:26:32,368 --> 00:26:35,108
it only took a few lives and a scapegoat...

297
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,878
for you to control whatever goes on in this world.

298
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:41,108
You said that powerful individuals and conglomerates...

299
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:43,647
grovel before you in order to get something out of this world...

300
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:45,778
and that none of them would hesitate to do you such favors.

301
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:47,487
You're right.

302
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:50,318
You're not the one behind this. You're only a tool.

303
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:54,528
You're in that position thanks to those who are obsessed...

304
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:55,927
with power and money.

305
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:58,098
So I pondered.

306
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:00,897
"How can I play him?"

307
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:03,028
And I immediately got the answer.

308
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:07,407
You're a detestable voyeur who enjoys using and hiding...

309
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:10,477
behind foolish, old men in order to ridicule the people.

310
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:13,237
So it's only right for me...

311
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:15,008
to ridicule you in front of the people.

312
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:18,147
What will you do now?

313
00:27:18,518 --> 00:27:20,887
No one will need you anymore...

314
00:27:22,588 --> 00:27:24,558
because you'll be useless.

315
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:29,358
You son of a...

316
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:33,197
You completely ruined my plan!

317
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:52,348
I'll be off now.

318
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:56,187
You all have no business with me.

319
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:01,828
Don't be ridiculous, you scumbag.

320
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:13,808
Okay.

321
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:16,167
Do you think doing this...

322
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,907
will make me useless?

323
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,677
In your dreams.

324
00:28:21,578 --> 00:28:24,447
This world is full of garbage like them.

325
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:26,477
These old men?

326
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:29,118
They can't do anything without me.

327
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:31,818
They are brainless fools...

328
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:35,887
who don't know what to do in order to get what they want.

329
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,227
Yes. I'm sure you're right.

330
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,028
But remember this.

331
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:45,197
If someone like you returns,

332
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:49,437
someone like me will definitely return, too.

- What are you doing? - Stop.

364
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:04,237
- Let me go! - Gosh.

365
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,407
- Jang In Gyu! - Let me go!

366
00:31:05,778 --> 00:31:07,977
Don't you know who I am?

367
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,647
I'm not interested in who you were up until now.

368
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:13,647
- What? - What's important is,

369
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:15,887
you're no longer anything...

370
00:31:17,157 --> 00:31:18,558
from this moment on.

371
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:20,427
You scumbag.

372
00:31:20,427 --> 00:31:21,457
- Take him. - Yes, sir.

373
00:31:21,828 --> 00:31:23,858
- Let's go. - You...

374
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,957
Let me go! Let go!

375
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:43,048
For the past 15 years,

376
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:46,147
I had been very curious.

377
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:53,157
I finally get to meet you.

378
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:08,508
You know what?

379
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:14,878
You look better on the screen.

380
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:17,548
You don't look that pretty in real life.

381
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:21,947
You're actually quite ugly.

382
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,358
- Please arrest him. - Yes, sir.

383
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:43,368
- Sir, we have a problem. - What?

384
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:49,048
What? They did?

385
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:50,677
Yes.

386
00:33:05,927 --> 00:33:07,128
- Run! - Okay!

387
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,798
(Police)

388
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:15,638
Hurry.

389
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:18,878
Hurry!

390
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:24,977
Darn it!

391
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:28,088
I told them to stop following us.

392
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:31,787
Let's go.

393
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,028
Go get the key.

394
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:44,167
There's nothing's here.

395
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,338
What should we do?

396
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,807
There's nothing. What are we going to do?

397
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:51,138
Ha Ri. What should we do?

398
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:56,178
Gosh, we're going to get caught.

399
00:33:56,477 --> 00:33:58,178
You idiot. What are you doing?

400
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,147
I told you not to follow me.

401
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:03,287
You're saying that again? Darn it!

402
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:08,388
I shouldn't have trusted and followed you. Gosh.

403
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,997
Hey, have you gone crazy? Are you smiling?

404
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:22,008
Gosh, is this funny?

405
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:23,138
My gosh.

406
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:27,508
Darn it!

407
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:32,747
The weather is darn good.

408
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:34,948
Hey.

409
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:37,388
We won't get to see each other for years.

410
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:39,017
For years, my foot.

411
00:34:39,218 --> 00:34:42,528
You will rot in jail for decades for beating people.

412
00:34:42,528 --> 00:34:45,897
Hey, I'll get out of prison before you, though.

413
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:47,327
Don't be ridiculous.

414
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:50,367
Hey, you passed the bar exam.

415
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,367
Whose crime is more serious? His or mine?

416
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:55,207
- You guys? - Yes.

417
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:56,508
How long are we going to be in jail?

418
00:34:56,568 --> 00:35:00,378
Well... You both will be sentenced to life.

419
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:03,608
- Gosh. - You'll be sentenced to death.

420
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:09,017
He should be in a labor camp for life.

421
00:35:09,017 --> 00:35:11,787
How can you be laughing at this moment?

422
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:15,187
- Gosh, I'm tired. - Is this funny?

423
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:17,057
I don't know.

424
00:35:18,258 --> 00:35:20,198
Hey, wait.

425
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:23,428
We forgot to do something. I forgot it.

426
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:25,298
- What? - Give me your phone.

427
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,068
Oh, right. Darn it.

428
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:29,138
Hurry. Give me your phone.

429
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:34,747
(Police)

430
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,548
We're coming.

431
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:38,647
Open it now.

432
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:41,088
(Police)

433
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:46,957
We can't do it now.

434
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:49,258
- It's okay. Stop it. It's done. - I couldn't do it.

435
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:50,798
I need to do this.

436
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:51,827
What's that?

437
00:35:53,658 --> 00:35:56,698
Hey, send it now. Hurry.

438
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,267
Get your hands up.

439
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:02,638
- All right. - Hands in the air.

440
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,807
I said, hands in the air.

441
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:08,577
- Get your hands up. - Okay.

442
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:09,878
All right.

443
00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:13,847
Arrest them.

444
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:18,888
Gosh, go easy on me.

445
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:23,327
I'm afraid of guns.

446
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,528
Please go easy on me.

447
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:30,767
I didn't do anything wrong. I never hit anyone.

448
00:36:42,178 --> 00:36:44,917
Gosh, I'm going.

449
00:36:45,117 --> 00:36:46,278
Gosh.

450
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:49,347
(Police)

451
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:55,158
Wait. Stop right there. Wait.

452
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:56,287
Prosecutor Jang.

453
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,698
(Police)

454
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:02,468
- Prosecutor Jang. - Let go of me.

455
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:06,037
Well... These guys...

456
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,408
only cooperated with us on the investigation.

457
00:37:33,158 --> 00:37:34,227
Let's go.

458
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:38,767
I guess he's a hawker.

459
00:37:55,218 --> 00:37:57,718
Darn it. You selfish jerks.

460
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:29,347
All right. Come here.

461
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:31,957
Cha Ah Ryung.

462
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:35,358
You might get upset when you watch this.

463
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:38,457
But we just wanted to say goodbye.

464
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:39,758
I'll go first.

465
00:38:39,758 --> 00:38:42,397
All right, Byung Min. You can go first.

466
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,238
Hello, Ah Ryung. It's me, Byung Min.

467
00:38:46,298 --> 00:38:47,437
Is this right?

468
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,207
I used to teach you how to use a computer.

469
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,977
You should be careful of strangers.

470
00:38:54,977 --> 00:38:58,378
You shouldn't use smartphone banking services at a cafe or something.

471
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,378
If someone hacks into the router,

472
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:02,888
they will steal all your personal information.

473
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:05,658
- Hey, it's my turn. - And the internet sites...

474
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:07,358
Let me go next.

475
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,957
- All right. Let's be quiet. - Gosh.

476
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,798
Ah Ryung. It's me, Jin Woong.

477
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:17,367
Ah Ryung, I don't need anything. Let me just say one thing.

478
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:20,167
Ah Ryung, the most important thing is your health.

479
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:24,008
If you keep eating instant noodles, I'll teach you a lesson.

480
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,908
- You should... - Stop eating instant noodles...

481
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:29,278
- and exercise more. - Hey, I'm not done yet.

482
00:39:29,278 --> 00:39:32,048
- Hey, I'm talking. - You should work out.

483
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:34,017
Hey, go over there.

484
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:36,048
- All right. - This is important.

485
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:39,388
Cha Ah Ryung. Well...

486
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:44,957
We decided to live like this long ago.

487
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:50,167
But you didn't have a choice when you were younger.

488
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:51,968
So from now on,

489
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:56,238
you should live as you please and as you want...

490
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,077
with your own choices. Okay?

491
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:00,108
Listen to your heart.

492
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:05,077
I was happy that I met you.

493
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:07,318
And I had a lot of fun.

494
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:11,588
You have to be happy, okay?

495
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:13,588
- Be happy! - Bye.

496
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:16,028
- You should work out. - And one more thing.

497
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:17,358
Make sure to take the vitamins.

498
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:19,097
They always get their own way.

499
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:39,647
Even after the presidential election,

500
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,187
the video called, That Person Scandal is...

501
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:44,218
still going viral online.

502
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:48,957
The man in the video sent from an anonymous informant...

503
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:50,597
turns out to Yeon Je Seok.

504
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:53,897
And new evidence is found that he's been working as...

505
00:40:53,897 --> 00:40:57,238
a political consultant of Min Chang Party for the past 15 years.

506
00:40:57,638 --> 00:40:59,568
- My gosh. - 15 years?

507
00:40:59,568 --> 00:41:02,867
He's also under suspicion that he has helped high ranking officials...

508
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:06,008
take advantage of loopholes in the law after committing corruption.

509
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:10,378
With the video and data...

510
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:12,778
provided by an anonymous informant,

511
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:15,687
the prosecution announced their plan to investigate the scandal...

512
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:19,517
as well as the presidential scandal from 15 years ago.

513
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:26,557
Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether the late Mr. Choi Hyun Ki...

514
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:29,198
who was blamed for the scandal 15 years ago...

515
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:31,037
will have his name cleared.

516
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:45,278
Prosecutor Jang.

517
00:41:46,218 --> 00:41:47,718
Do you really have to do this?

518
00:41:49,388 --> 00:41:52,758
I just can't sneak out of this alone.

519
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:54,858
Still...

520
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:04,367
Investigator Kim Tae Hyun.

521
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:07,037
Investigator Hong Sung Min.

522
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:08,838
Investigator Jung Do Yeon.

523
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:10,707
Investigator Lee Hye Young.

524
00:42:11,077 --> 00:42:12,537
Investigator Im Jin Dong.

525
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,378
Investigator Noh Young Il.

526
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:17,448
Thank you...

527
00:42:19,218 --> 00:42:20,847
for all your hard work.

528
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:26,057
Please take good care of the rest.

529
00:42:28,787 --> 00:42:29,988
Prosecutor Jang.

530
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:39,867
Sir.

531
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,307
Prosecutor Jang.

532
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:55,808
(Witness Stand)

533
00:42:57,648 --> 00:43:00,248
(Court)

534
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,677
(Defendant)

535
00:43:02,677 --> 00:43:03,717
Witness.

536
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:06,918
Is everything you just testified the truth?

537
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:17,268
Yes.

538
00:43:18,398 --> 00:43:19,597
It's all true, sir.

539
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:28,407
I requested that they help me with this case,

540
00:43:29,538 --> 00:43:32,277
and it was me who ordered them to bring me the evidence.

541
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,617
Also, as for the illegal acts committed in the process,

542
00:43:37,518 --> 00:43:39,088
using my discretion as a prosecutor,

543
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:41,958
I overlooked all of it.

544
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:44,628
That's ridiculous.

545
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:47,527
That man sure is a strange person.

546
00:43:48,097 --> 00:43:50,697
Are you trying to take credit for all that we've done?

547
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:54,097
You'll overdo yourself by being so greedy.

548
00:43:55,237 --> 00:43:57,137
We've never even met. Don't you think this is too much?

549
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:58,237
Please be quiet.

550
00:43:59,808 --> 00:44:00,878
Witness.

551
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:03,847
Do you have evidence that can support your statement?

552
00:44:07,717 --> 00:44:10,617
Yes, I do, sir.

553
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:29,838
This is the cell phone I gave them to use when communicating with me.

554
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:32,467
We normally communicated with this phone.

555
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:33,737
The call history...

556
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:37,108
has mostly been deleted because those guys hacked the phone.

557
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:39,608
But when I first asked them to do this job,

558
00:44:39,608 --> 00:44:41,277
I made an audio file of our conversation.

559
00:44:44,217 --> 00:44:46,347
The file's still left untouched on this phone.

560
00:44:48,257 --> 00:44:50,257
You just have to bring me solid evidence.

561
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,058
It has to be hard evidence that'll catch them for sure.

562
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:58,697
As for any money you may happen to get in the process,

563
00:45:01,768 --> 00:45:03,168
- we'll split in half. - Excuse me?

564
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:04,907
I'm just kidding.

565
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:07,108
You take it all.

566
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:10,777
- I can promise you that. - How can we trust you?

567
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:15,577
Everything we've discussed here today...

568
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:17,518
(5 minutes and 23 seconds)

569
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:18,788
has been recorded on this.

570
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:23,558
We'll communicate strictly with this phone.

571
00:45:26,088 --> 00:45:28,097
(Defendant)

572
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:31,668
I'd like to submit...

573
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:34,498
this cell phone as evidence.

574
00:45:35,097 --> 00:45:36,197
I approve.

575
00:45:59,688 --> 00:46:00,757
Please play the recording.

576
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:10,168
I'll introduce myself to you formally.

577
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:12,967
I'm from the special investigation team Seoun Prosecutors' Office.

578
00:46:26,088 --> 00:46:28,558
(Defendant)

579
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,697
(Judge's Bench)

580
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:40,797
Silence, please.

581
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:44,608
Witness. Are you trying to play jokes in court?

582
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,608
Your Honor, there must've been a mistake.

583
00:46:48,177 --> 00:46:49,577
What are you doing? Turn that off this instant.

584
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:50,878
Yes, Your Honor.

585
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:53,818
Red flavor.

586
00:46:55,818 --> 00:46:56,847
Don't look at me. I don't know.

587
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:03,958
I've reached my final judgment.

588
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:07,797
Inmate 3294, Choi Su Hyuk.

589
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:10,427
Including fraud, blackmail,

590
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:12,697
special larceny, robbery resulting in injury,

591
00:47:13,027 --> 00:47:14,938
assault, and obstruction of business,

592
00:47:15,038 --> 00:47:17,867
the defendant has committed a total of fourteen crimes.

593
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,878
Although the purpose of their actions was...

594
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:23,177
to punish criminals pursuing gain,

595
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:26,878
we cannot ignore the damage that was caused in the process...

596
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:29,677
or can we consider their crime as minor.

597
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:33,887
Therefore, I sentence...

598
00:47:34,257 --> 00:47:36,858
the defendant Do Jin Woong to 12 years in prison,

599
00:47:37,657 --> 00:47:40,128
the defendant Lim Byung Min to 12 years in prison...

600
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:43,728
and Choi Su Hyuk to 15 years in prison.

601
00:47:44,168 --> 00:47:45,697
That's my final judgment.

602
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,197
One moment, please.

603
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:51,268
Wait a minute.

604
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:54,478
Let me have a word with him, please.

605
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,117
What's that look on your face?

606
00:48:05,588 --> 00:48:06,918
Did someone die here?

607
00:48:11,027 --> 00:48:12,088
Why did you do that?

608
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:14,327
You didn't have to do that.

609
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:17,327
Why are you guys taking the blame for what I did?

610
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,998
Who'll put those scumbags away if you go to jail?

611
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:24,168
- Don't you guys agree? - He's right, Prosecutor.

612
00:48:24,507 --> 00:48:26,308
You should work harder for our sake, don't you think?

613
00:48:27,177 --> 00:48:29,338
Forget about getting some rest in jail.

614
00:48:29,938 --> 00:48:33,608
By the way, the money we earned doing this job...

615
00:48:35,018 --> 00:48:37,947
has all been put away in a safe in our hangout.

616
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:40,387
You go collect it...

617
00:48:42,818 --> 00:48:43,927
justly, that is.

618
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:45,927
What?

619
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:53,128
You're crazy.

620
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:01,737
Hang in there just a bit longer,

621
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,248
Jang In Gyu.

622
00:49:09,978 --> 00:49:11,047
Prosecutor.

623
00:49:16,157 --> 00:49:17,288
- Su Hyuk. - We'll be going now.

624
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:20,858
Prosecutor. There's a lot of money in the safe.

625
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:22,958
- Hide some of it for us. - Hurry up and go.

626
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,898
- Or maybe you can... - Hurry up and just go.

627
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:26,128
Forget what he just said.

628
00:49:29,998 --> 00:49:31,168
I'll call you when I get out, Prosecutor.

629
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,177
(Ministry of Justice)

630
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:50,257
Su Hyuk.

631
00:49:55,228 --> 00:49:58,168
(Ministry of Justice)

632
00:50:01,237 --> 00:50:02,268
Gosh.

633
00:50:03,338 --> 00:50:05,737
I never imagined I'd ride in one of these vans.

634
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:08,608
It was in the "The A-Team" movie.

635
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:10,277
- It was, wasn't it? - Yes.

636
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:11,878
It's sure is snazzy though.

637
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:16,047
I still don't get it though.

638
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:19,947
Wasn't he too harsh sentencing 15 years just to me?

639
00:50:19,947 --> 00:50:22,058
What did I do so wrong to deserve 15 years?

640
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:25,527
You're wrong. The judge made the right judgment.

641
00:50:25,728 --> 00:50:27,398
You're the most vicious...

642
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:29,157
and on top of that, you were our boss.

643
00:50:29,157 --> 00:50:30,668
If you think about, our country's judiciary sure is fair.

644
00:50:30,668 --> 00:50:32,628
Indeed. Justice still prevails.

645
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:33,697
Justice?

646
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,268
If justice still existed, you two would get the death penalty.

647
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:37,268
Don't be ridiculous.

648
00:50:37,907 --> 00:50:39,038
Darn it.

649
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:41,338
Just wait eight years. I'll go visit you two.

650
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,378
Did you say 8 years? You've been sentenced to 12 years.

651
00:50:43,378 --> 00:50:45,608
As soon as I go in, I'll be a model prisoner.

652
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:46,648
You a model prisoner?

653
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,478
My goodness. That'll never happen.

654
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,717
What? You should watch what you say.

655
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:53,887
Troublemakers like you...

656
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:57,657
are the type that get beaten all the time.

657
00:50:57,657 --> 00:50:59,558
You should worry about yourself.

658
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:06,467
Looking back, I think I had the most fun working with you guys.

659
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:07,697
I agree.

660
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:10,867
My life sure was full of ups and downs.

661
00:51:24,188 --> 00:51:25,487
Oh, dear. I think I'm going to cry.

662
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:29,458
I suffer from narcolepsy. I'm narcoleptic.

663
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,088
- Get up, you jerk. - Hold on.

664
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,027
Manager. This is Chief Maeng you're talking to.

665
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:36,097
I'll keep a close eye on them. Don't worry. Take your time.

666
00:51:38,668 --> 00:51:41,538
You're such a valuable person, so I've come to pick you up.

667
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:43,068
I can't seem to say no for some reason.

668
00:51:43,068 --> 00:51:44,137
Hurry up.

669
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:46,208
You scum. Take this.

670
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:48,938
Why? Are you falling for me?

671
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:55,918
Stop right there!

672
00:51:58,887 --> 00:52:00,088
You're amazing.

673
00:52:03,617 --> 00:52:04,657
Watch out.

674
00:52:07,027 --> 00:52:08,858
We made it.

675
00:52:08,858 --> 00:52:09,898
Let's stay positive.

676
00:52:11,898 --> 00:52:14,168
It was all there. Did you do it? Did you?

677
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:16,097
- Who did it? - Why did you do it?

678
00:52:16,097 --> 00:52:17,708
- You shouldn't have! - Yes.

679
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:20,478
- All of us. - You punk!

680
00:52:25,677 --> 00:52:27,847
- I should get my pay. Okay. - Me too.

681
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:29,117
Give me 30 dollars so that I can buy some chicken breasts.

682
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:30,117
- No. - He eats too much.

683
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:32,688
- Give it to me. - Don't use violence.

684
00:52:32,688 --> 00:52:34,458
- Lower your chin. - Why should I?

685
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:36,058
1, 2... Okay!

686
00:52:36,058 --> 00:52:37,427
1, 2...

687
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:40,027
Good job.

688
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:47,237
- Until when will you wear that? - Here.

689
00:52:47,737 --> 00:52:49,467
That fool.

690
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,608
Say cheese.

691
00:52:55,608 --> 00:52:57,608
- This will be uploaded. - Heart.

692
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:58,608
What is this?

693
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:01,547
- Nice! - Yes!

694
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:05,418
Good job, Ah Ryung.

695
00:53:07,657 --> 00:53:09,657
This thing really goes!

696
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:17,898
- Gosh, Ah Ryung. - I like the shoulders.

697
00:53:17,898 --> 00:53:19,268
They're just amazed by your beauty.

698
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:20,467
- Or we can pull a badger game. - A badger game? Who will?

699
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,597
- Or we can pull a badger game. - A badger game? Who will?

700
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:22,668
I'm seriously going to kill you.

701
00:53:22,668 --> 00:53:25,608
Who do you think? But seriously, who will?

702
00:53:25,608 --> 00:53:27,208
- Cheers. - Cheers.

703
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,277
You're such a blabbermouth.

704
00:53:29,277 --> 00:53:31,648
- You have a big mouth. - How could you?

705
00:53:31,648 --> 00:53:33,717
I don't think that way of you.

706
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:35,378
Good work, guys!

707
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:50,157
Yes.

708
00:53:51,998 --> 00:53:53,697
We had a blast.

709
00:53:56,898 --> 00:53:58,768
Would Ah Ryung think the same?

710
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:00,708
Of course.

711
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:02,907
She will.

712
00:54:05,077 --> 00:54:07,978
You know, I actually miss her.

713
00:54:08,847 --> 00:54:12,688
At first, she was very rude, and I hated her guts.

714
00:54:13,588 --> 00:54:15,018
I guess she grew on you.

715
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,427
How dare you brazenly mention my name after abandoning me?

716
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:21,398
Am I hearing things?

717
00:54:21,398 --> 00:54:22,697
- Me too. - You too?

718
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:24,728
- You too? - Gosh.

719
00:54:25,297 --> 00:54:28,737
Seeing how we're hearing things, I guess we really do miss her.

720
00:54:28,737 --> 00:54:30,507
- Right? - Yes.

721
00:54:30,507 --> 00:54:33,367
- Wait, what if it's a ghost? - Goodness.

722
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:34,737
- What if? - A ghost?

723
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:36,637
She can't be...

724
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,418
- dead, right? - Dead?

725
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:43,617
Why would I be?

726
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:47,588
What are you doing here?

727
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,558
- What is this? - Ah Ryung!

728
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,128
What's going on?

729
00:55:09,277 --> 00:55:10,378
Prosecutor...

730
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:12,978
Jang In Gyu.

731
00:55:23,018 --> 00:55:25,088
- What is this? - Ah Ryung?

732
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,157
Ah Ryung!

733
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:27,927
Ah Ryung!

734
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:29,697
- What's going on? - Ah Ryung!

735
00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:33,168
What was that?

736
00:55:33,168 --> 00:55:34,438
- Look at him. - Hey!

737
00:55:34,637 --> 00:55:35,867
You told me...

738
00:55:35,938 --> 00:55:38,737
to live as I please from now on.

739
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,208
I chose to do this.

740
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,427
Prosecutor Jang, we found it!

741
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:41,697
You should've tipped us off.

742
00:56:41,697 --> 00:56:43,907
You're really incredible.

743
00:56:43,907 --> 00:56:45,237
I know.

744
00:56:45,637 --> 00:56:47,407
Hey. Hold on, Ah Ryung.

745
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:49,407
What happened to our money?

746
00:56:59,518 --> 00:57:01,518
(30 dollars)

747
00:57:03,058 --> 00:57:04,588
This is everything.

748
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:09,697
(30 dollars)

749
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:19,808
Those punks.

750
00:57:23,277 --> 00:57:25,208
- Are you okay, sir? - Yes.

751
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:36,387
Let's go.

752
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:39,987
I brought it with me.

753
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,527
- Really? - I knew it.

754
00:57:41,998 --> 00:57:45,998
- Yes! - She really is a trickster.

755
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:47,068
She is.

756
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,668
Does this mean we're starting all over again?

757
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:51,668
All over again?

758
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:53,308
All over again?

759
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:56,838
Strangely, I can't refuse this offer.

760
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:02,077
All right, then. Let's slowly start again.

761
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:03,918
- All of us, okay? - Let's do it!

762
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:06,648
- Okay! - Okay!

763
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:09,418
- Go, go, go! - Let's go!

764
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:10,728
Let's go!

765
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:12,927
- Yes! - The police are behind us.

766
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:14,728
We need to get rid of them!

767
00:58:14,728 --> 00:58:16,927
Hey, step on the gas pedal!

768
00:58:17,068 --> 00:58:18,768
- Let's go! - Okay!

769
00:58:24,637 --> 00:58:27,637
- Nice! - Let's go!

770
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:31,007
(We thank our viewers for watching The Player.)

771
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:54,597
(The Player)

772
00:59:01,907 --> 00:59:04,808
I have something

773
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:07,117
- To tell you - Look at them.

774
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:11,818
She pretty much shot a commercial.

775
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:13,688
- Why? - She really did.

776
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:18,788
Hello, viewers.

777
00:59:18,827 --> 00:59:21,458
Hello, everyone.

778
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:22,797
That's good.

779
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:24,097
Good job.

780
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:25,427
Action.

781
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:27,637
Get out?

782
00:59:29,367 --> 00:59:31,308
Come on.

783
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,708
Goodness, good job, everyone.

784
00:59:34,907 --> 00:59:37,077
Good job and thank you, everyone.

785
00:59:37,308 --> 00:59:39,108
Now, dance!
